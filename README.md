# ibm-monitoring-grafana-operator

>**Important:** Do not install this operator directly. Only install this operator using the IBM Common Services Operator. For more information about installing this operator and other Common Services operators, see [Installer documentation](http://ibm.biz/cpcs_opinstall). If you are using this operator as part of an IBM Cloud Pak, see the documentation for that IBM Cloud Pak to learn more about how to install and use the operator service. For more information about IBM Cloud Paks, see [IBM Cloud Paks that use Common Services](http://ibm.biz/cpcs_cloudpaks).

- The ibm-monitoring-grafana-operator installs the Grafana service. Use the Grafana service to present metrics dashboards that you can use for monitoring. You can also create your own metrics dashboards.
